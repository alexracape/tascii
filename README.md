## About

This project was part of a course on design and human computer interaction. We started with needfinding studies and mock-ups, and through an iterative design process we encorporated user feedback to developed this high fidelity prototype. 

Each folder contains different information relating to this design process. 
- `code` contains the source code for our web application
- `data` contains the raw data we collected during needfinding and usability studies
- `design` contains screenshots of the user interface along with some some commentary about our design decisions
- `final_report` contains a LaTeX document and a pdf with an overarching review of our work

These folders all contain there own documentation which goes into greater detail. We encourage you to dig around and check out our work!
